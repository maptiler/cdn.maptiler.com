# Purpose
This asset folder is dedicated to hosting non-code static assets such as images that are not specific to a particular project: language logos icons, MapTiler logo, etc. The primary goal is to host images for private repos, so that they still show up on NPM.

# Project-specific assets?
If a project is hosted on a private MapTiler GitHub while still being published on a public NPM and has specific assets such as screenshots to show on the readme, they should be moved under the specific project in this CDN repo, for instance `/maptiler-weather/assets/`.
